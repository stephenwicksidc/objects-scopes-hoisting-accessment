# 1
Warm up
Scope
- Study the code bellow and answer the following without checking the console.
- Are the variables what they claim to be?
- What would console.log(y) and console.log(x) print? Why?
- Write you answer bellow the code.
**************************************************************************************/
(function(){
  "use strict";

  var x = "I'm a local variable";
  //console.log(y)

  function scopeThis(){
    var y = "I'm a global variable";
    console.log(x);
  }
  scopeThis();
})();
/*************************************************************************************
------------ ANSWER -------------------
console.log(y) - This will print an error saying the variable has not been declared because y has not been declared within the scope.
console.log(x) - This will print "I'm a local variable" because x was defined within the outer function's scope.

- Study the code bellow and answer the following without checking the console.
- What would console.log(x) and console.log(foo) print? Why?
- Write you answer bellow the code.

    }
  }

})();
/*************************************************************************************
------------ ANSWER -------------------
x is going to be undefined.  It's been declared by hoisting, but undefined.

foo() will print function hoisting.

Date Object
- Declare a variable 'todayIs'.
- Using the date constructor, it should print today's date.

/**************************************************************************************
# 4
Warm up
- Study the code below. What will console.log(add) (inside the IFEE and outside) print? Why? Write your answer below.
- Do not uncomment console.log(add);
**************************************************************************************/
(function() {
  "use strict";
  const add = 2 + 2;
  //console.log(add);
})();
//console.log(add);
/**************************************************************************************
------------ ANSWER -------------------
Inside the IFEE will produce the number 4 as the result.  Outside the IFEE will produce 

Outside the IFEE will produce undefined because the IFEE protects variables from being used outside of itself.

Object notation
Hoisting
- Using dot notation, do the following:
  - add a property of "sauceType" with a value of "tomato".
  - add a property of "protien" with a value of "chicken".
  - add a propety of "orderNow" with a value of that would make it pass the assertion.
  - add a property of "sauce" with a value of that would make it pass the assertion.
- Fix hoisting issues
- It should return, "We are making your pizza with tomato and chicken. Pickup in 20 minutes.".

Object notation
- Study the code below, line by line, carefully. Keep hoisting and scope in mind.
- Add the following properties to 'benefit' using bracket notation:
  - "credit" with a value of 50.
  - "discount" with a value of 5.
- Complete the missing return statement.
- 'name' must be set to 'James' as a local variable in one of the functions. It should also change the global variable in order for the assertion to pass.
-It should return: "Hello James. Here is the status of your account. Thank you for your loyalty. You've been a member for 18 months . You next bill will reflect a $50 credit and a 5% discount going forward."
HINTS:
- Don't be overwhelmed by the length of the function. Read the instructions carefully. Read it line by line, keeping hoisting and scope in mind. You've got this.
- First fix hoisting issues.
- One of the variables is missing something.
- Are the functions being called when they are supposed to?
